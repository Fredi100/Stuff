This little program extracts specific fields from the given link and
creates one line containing all of that information so the user can simply copy it.

If the input field gets the focus, it will empty itself.

If the window already has the focus and the user rightclicks inside of the input field,
it will copy every text that i currently present in the clipboard.

If the window does not have the focus, the user has to give it the focus in order to be
able to use the clipboard function.

To etract the needed information the user just hast to insert the url of the website and press enter.
The program will then try to extract the specific information. If the website is not supported the
program will tell the user.
